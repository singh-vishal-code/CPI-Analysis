**Approach towards Data analysis and Data visualization**
In analysing Indiaâ€™s Consumer Price Index (CPI - UNME), I followed a structured 
approach that included trend evaluation, inflation rate computation, 
seasonality detection, forecasting, and economic impact assessment. My first 
step was data preprocessing and cleaning, where I identified and addressed 
any missing values or anomalies. To ensure the accuracy of my time series 
analysis, I properly formatted and sorted the Datetime Index.
When examining trends, I observed a consistent upward movement in CPI, 
confirming long-term inflation. To quantify this, I calculated the year-over-year 
percentage change, which provided a clear picture of how inflation rates 
fluctuated over time. To standardize comparisons, I indexed all CPI values to 
the year 2000 (set as 100), making it easier to visualize price changes across 
different time periods.
Understanding seasonality was also crucial, as inflation often follows recurring 
patterns. I used boxplots and rolling averages to detect monthly fluctuations, 
which I found were influenced by festivals, agricultural cycles, and policy 
interventions. These seasonal trends helped explain short-term price 
movements within a broader economic context.
To predict future inflation trends, I applied the ARIMA (1,1,1) model, which 
projected a continued rise in CPI over the next five years. This reinforced 
concerns about inflationary pressures and the need for effective economic 
policies. Additionally, I studied the impact of major economic events, 
particularly the 1991 economic crisis and the 2008 financial crisis. By analysing
CPI data from these periods, I observed sharp fluctuations, confirming that 
significant economic disruptions have a direct impact on inflation.
To enhance my analysis, I used various visualization techniques. Line plots
helped illustrate long-term trends and forecast projections, while boxplots
highlighted seasonal inflation variations. I also used scatter plots to pinpoint 
CPI spikes during major economic events, offering a clearer view of inflationary 
shocks.
Through this process, I gained valuable insights into India's inflation trends, the 
key factors driving price changes, and the potential trajectory of future 
inflation. By combining statistical modelling with data visualization, I was able 
to build a clearer understanding of how inflation behaves and how it responds 
to macroeconomic shifts.
